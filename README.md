Project Description
===

The goal of L4D2 Gore Loader is to allow censored copies of Left 4 Dead 2 to be uncensored. It achives this by pretending it is actually just playing L4D2 Dedicated Server which does not restrict the gore. The change is simple to do using the file system (editing two files) but with constant steam updates and the want to go back to normal to get achivement it is nice to have the process automated. This tool also allows you to launch l4d2 so it is intended to be a 'launcher' so you only need to run it. It will close the application as soon as you launch L4D2 so that no one suspects it does any trickery and risk getting banned.

Current Release
===
1.3.0.0 - This fixes the 'Unable to determine version' of the steam.inf file due to changes in a recent patch.
